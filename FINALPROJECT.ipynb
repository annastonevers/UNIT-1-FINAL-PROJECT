    "IF models are one of the simplest neuron models. They integrate synaptic currents and fire a spike once the membrane potential reaches a predefined threshold, after which they reset. The IF model does not account for natural leakage of current across the membrane (leaky ion channels), and neurons in this model do not have a refractory period. Also in the IF model, membrane potential increases linearly and does not decay overtime. However, the LIF model has a nonlinear relationship between current and voltage. The LIF model is quite similar to the IF model, but it contains leaky ion channels, which allow for the membrane potential to exhibit a more natural decay. Some limitations of this model include that it requires an artificial spike generator to initiate action potentials, and it is missing the opening and closing of voltage-gated ion channels. A simple feedforward neural network (FNN) has the ability to learn and adapt, unlike IF/LIF models, and responds directly to inputs. However, it is more difficult to make predictions compared to other biologically inspired models. The LIF model contains more information than the IF model due to the inclusion of the leak, while the IF model is more binary and concise. The FNN, being the most complex, stores the most bits over time, making it the model with the greatest information content."
