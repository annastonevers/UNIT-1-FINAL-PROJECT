    " ## Model Comparison\n",
    "IF models are one of the simplest neuron models. They integrate synaptic currents and fire a spike once the membrane potential reaches a predefined threshold, after which they reset. The IF model does not account for natural leakage of current across the membrane (leaky ion channels), and neurons in this model do not have a refractory period. Also in the IF model, membrane potential increases linearly and does not decay overtime. However, the LIF model has a nonlinear relationship between current and voltage. The LIF model is quite similar to the IF model, but it contains leaky ion channels, which allow for the membrane potential to exhibit a more natural decay. Some limitations of this model include that it requires an artificial spike generator to initiate action potentials, and it is missing the opening and closing of voltage-gated ion channels. A simple feedforward neural network (FNN) has the ability to learn and adapt, unlike IF/LIF models, and responds directly to inputs. However, this model has issues with making predictions and responding to novel situations. This system contains an actuator, which does the actual output action, and a controller, which provides the instructions for the actuator. One benefit of this model is that if the controller has good instructions, this model can respond both very quickly AND accurately. The LIF model contains more information than the IF model due to the inclusion of leaky channels, while the IF model is more binary and concise. The FNN, being the most complex, stores the most bits over time, making it the model with the greatest information content."

    "### Visualization of Differing Inputs\n",
    "The plots below illustrate the firing patterns if the inputs given differ. The first scenario (blue) has a weak input (5 uA/cm^2), which does not reach the threshold, resulting in no action potentials. The second scenario (orange) features bursts of input (10 uA/cm^2), triggering multiple spikes in response to each burst. This demonstrates how input patterns affect neuronal firing, highlighting the importance of stimulus intensity and timing.\n",
