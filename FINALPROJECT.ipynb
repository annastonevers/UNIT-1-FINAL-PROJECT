    " ## Model Comparison\n",
    "IF models are one of the simplest neuron models. They integrate synaptic currents and fire a spike once the membrane potential reaches a predefined threshold, after which they reset. The IF model does not account for natural leakage of current across the membrane (leaky ion channels), and neurons in this model do not have a refractory period. Also in the IF model, membrane potential increases linearly and does not decay overtime. However, the LIF model has a nonlinear relationship between current and voltage. The LIF model is quite similar to the IF model, but it contains leaky ion channels, which allow for the membrane potential to exhibit a more natural decay. Some limitations of this model include that it requires an artificial spike generator to initiate action potentials, and it is missing the opening and closing of voltage-gated ion channels. A simple feedforward neural network (FNN) has the ability to learn and adapt, unlike IF/LIF models, and responds directly to inputs. However, this model has issues with making predictions and responding to novel situations. This system contains an actuator, which does the actual output action, and a controller, which provides the instructions for the actuator. One benefit of this model is that if the controller has good instructions, this model can respond both very quickly AND accurately. The LIF model contains more information than the IF model due to the inclusion of leaky channels, while the IF model is more binary and concise. The FNN, being the most complex, stores the most bits over time, making it the model with the greatest information content."

    "### Visualization of Differing Inputs\n",
    "The plots below illustrate the firing patterns if the inputs given differ. The input current patterns are modified in this Hodgkin-Huxley model to illustrate the different types of stimuli that affect neuronal firing. In the previous model a single, constant input current was applied for a period of time between 50ms to 150ms. This was replaced with two other input patterns: a weak, subthreshold input (3.0 uA/cm²) that is continuous over the same time block and a burst input (15.0 uA/cm²) that is added in short pulses at separate intervals of 50-60ms, 80-90ms, and 110-120ms. This results in differences in the membrane potential. The subthreshold input did not generate action potentials because it did not reach the threshold, however, the burst input had several spikes, because it depolarized to trigger an action potential. In the stimulus current graph, the weak input is a smooth, continuous signal, while the burst input showed distinct, intermittent peaks.\n",

    "The plots below illustrate the firing patterns if inhibitory inputs are added on to the model. The solid blue line represents the neuron receiving only excitatory input, leading to action potential spikes. The dashed red line represents the neuron receiving both excitatory and inhibitory inputs, where inhibition suppresses the spikes. The second plot shows the input current patterns where the inhibitory input is overlapping with excitatory inputs, which counteracts its effect. This shows how the inhibitory inputs are reducing spikes.\n",
