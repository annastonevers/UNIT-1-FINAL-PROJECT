    "The IF model is simple and fires when a certain threshold voltage is reached. It is computationally efficient but lacks biological features such as refractory periods and adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 2: Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) Model\n",

    "### Model 3: Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)\n",

    "### Information Theory Discussion\n",
    "The FNN likely contains the most bits, as it stores information over time and adjusts based on the inputs. The IF model is the most concise, while the LIF model sits between the two, being more biologically accurate than the IF model but simpler than the FNN.\n"
