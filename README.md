    "### Comparison of Models\n",
    "IF models are one of the simplest neuron models. They integrate synaptic currents and fire a spike once the membrane potential reaches a predefined threshold. They then reset. These models lack a refractory period of a biological neuron as well as other characteristics such as leakage and adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "LIF models improve upon this by incorporating a leak in the membrane potential. So, if no input is received, the potential will gradually return to resting state. This model is more biologically accurate but still lacks a refractory period and any ion channel dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple feedforward neural network has the ability to learn and adapt, unlike IF/LIF models. It responds directly to inputs. However, it is more difficult to make predictions compared to other biologically inspired models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LIF model contains more information than the IF model since it includes the leak. The IF model is most binary given its set pattern, making it more discrete and the most concise. The FNN is the most complex and contains the most bits since it is able to store information over time."
